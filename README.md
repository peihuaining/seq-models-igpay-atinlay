# Sequential Learning to convert English to Pig-Latin

## The following Machine Translation models are implemented:
- A vanilla sequence to sequence network, consisting of two RNNs (encoder + decoder) 
- A seq2seq network, with attention mechanism to assist the model performance.
- A basic transformers based model to further boost performance.
